# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the README.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take screenshots of the commands:**
   - Run `./dockit ps` and take a screenshot → save as `dockit-ps.png`
   - Run `./dockit images` and take a screenshot → save as `dockit-images.png`

2. **Screenshot tips:**
   - Use a terminal with a dark background for contrast
   - Make sure the output shows the colors clearly
   - Capture the full output including the summary line
   - Recommended terminal width: ~100 characters

3. **Place the files here:**
   ```
   assets/screenshots/
   ├── dockit-ps.png
   └── dockit-images.png
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add assets/screenshots/*.png
   git commit -m "Add screenshots to README"
   git push
   ```

The README.md already references these files, so once you add them, they'll show up automatically on GitHub!

- Font: Monaco, Menlo, or Fira Code
